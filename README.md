PROJECT 02: LOGICAL AGENT
A logical agent that navigates through the  Wumpus World. The goal of the project is to set up a program to explore the Wumpus world and get the highest score possible 
for that world, using either Propositional Logic or First-Order Logic (or both)

# Specifications
Input: the given map is represented by matrix, which is stored in the input file, for example, map1.txt. 
The input file format is described as follows:
− The first line contains an integer N, which is the size of map.
− N next lines with each line represents a string. If room empty, it is marked by hyphen character 
(-). If room has some things or signal such as Wumpus(W), Pit(P), Breeze(B), Stench(S), 
Agent(A) or Gold(G). Between two adjacent rooms is separated by a dot (.)
− For example: -.BS.W.BS.P.B.-.-.-.
Output: a result with path for agent, game point will be displayed on screen and/or written in output 
text file such as result1.txt.
